ASSOLO is a new active probing tool for estimating available bandwidth based on the concept of "self-induced congestion". ASSOLO features a new probing traffic profile called REACH (Reflected ExponentiAl Chirp), which tests a wide range of rates being more accurate in the center of the probing interval. Moreover, the tool runs inside a real-time operating system and uses some de-noising techniques to improve the measurement process. Experimental results show that ASSOLO outperforms pathChirp, a state-of-the-art measurement tool, estimating available bandwidth with greater accuracy and stability.
